I was able to successfully read and write binary files during this project.
However, when I try to open the .wo files created by my program with waveshow
or wavediff, I get a message saying they appear to be corrupted. But at the 
same time, my program is able to read and use the output files it writes as 
the inputs to the following run. For this reason, I have my program print
the key items of the output file to the command line. Notably, it first writes
the output file, then reads in the output it just wrote into a waveorthotope
object, then prints the data from that object. So you can see it has no 
problem reading and using the outputs it writes.
