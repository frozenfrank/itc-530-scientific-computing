Similarly to phase 2, running waveshow or similar on my program's output binary will
result in a message saying the file is corrupted. I'm still not sure why this is
but, my program is able to read the checkpoints and outputs it writes. To show this,
after my program solves the wave orthotope, it writes to the user specified out file
then reads that same out file it just wrote into a 2nd wave orthotope object. 
It then takes that 2nd wave orthotope and prints the values for N, m, time, etc. 
In phase two, I had it output the resulting u and v matrices as well but this proved
too long for the timed simulations. I commented out those portions but you can uncomment
them on lines 421 and line 439 if you want to see.
